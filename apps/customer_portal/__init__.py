    Key Logic and Content for customer_portal App:
Customer Profile Management

View/Edit Profile: Allow customers to view and edit their personal details, such as name, email, and phone number.
Profile Picture: Let customers upload and manage their profile picture.
Change Password: Provide functionality for customers to change their password.
Why? This is crucial to allow customers to manage their accounts and keep their information up-to-date.
Interaction with Accounts App: The accounts app will handle the user model and authentication logic.

Service Browsing

List Services: Display all available services provided by various partners (e.g., salon services, spa treatments).
Service Details: Allow customers to view detailed information about a specific service (name, description, price, duration).
Search & Filter Services: Let customers filter and search services based on categories, price, or location.
View Partner Details: Show basic details of the service providers (e.g., name, rating, available services).
Why? Service browsing is the core functionality of the customer experience. Customers will want to see and explore the services available to them.
Interaction with Core App: The core app should provide service types, service data, and partner details.

Bookings & Appointments

Create Bookings: Allow customers to book an appointment for a service.
View/Edit Bookings: Show a list of upcoming appointments and let customers reschedule or cancel them if needed.
Check Availability: Display available time slots for booking based on partner or service specialist availability (handled by the bookings app).
Why? This is the main purpose of the app – allowing customers to book services.
Interaction with Bookings App: The bookings app will handle the logic for available time slots, bookings, and reservations.

Notifications

Booking Confirmation: Notify customers about booking confirmations and reminders.
Promotional Messages: Send special offers or promotions (e.g., discounts, new services).
Booking Updates: Send notifications about any changes to their bookings (cancellations, modifications).
Why? Customers need to be notified about the status of their bookings and new offers.
Interaction with Notifications App: The notifications app will manage the sending of all customer notifications.

Payment & Transaction Management

Payment for Bookings: Handle online payments for booked services (integrate with payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal).
Transaction History: Allow customers to view past payments and invoices for services they’ve used.
Refunds: If applicable, handle refunds for canceled or failed services.
Why? Payment is integral to completing bookings and keeping track of financial transactions.
Interaction with Payments App: The payments app will process transactions and store payment history.

Ratings & Reviews

Rate Services/Partners: After completing a service, customers should be able to rate the service or the partner.
Write Reviews: Customers can provide feedback on their experience.
View Reviews: Allow customers to see ratings and reviews for different services or partners.
Why? This will help other customers make decisions and allow businesses to gather feedback.
Interaction with Core App: The core app may manage the storage of reviews and ratings.

Customer Support

Contact Support: Let customers contact support through forms or chat.
FAQ: Display frequently asked questions to resolve common queries.
Tickets: If applicable, allow customers to create and track support tickets.
Why? Good customer service is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction.
Interaction with Accounts/Other Apps: The accounts app may manage support tickets and contact information.

Loyalty Programs (if applicable)

Points System: If you have a rewards or loyalty system, customers should be able to track and redeem their points.
Promotions: Show discounts or special offers available to loyal customers.
Why? Encouraging repeat business is a good strategy for retention.
Interaction with Core or Accounts App: The core app can manage loyalty points, while the accounts app may store customer-specific loyalty data.

Structure of the customer_portal App:
Models:

CustomerProfile (if needed, to extend user profiles with additional customer-specific data like preferences, loyalty points, etc.)
Booking (if you need to manage temporary or local booking data before sending it to the bookings app)
Review (if the core app doesn’t handle reviews directly)
Views:

Use class-based views (CBVs) or function-based views (FBVs) to handle customer requests for services, bookings, and reviews.
Include authentication checks for accessing certain features like viewing/editing profiles or booking services.
Serializers:

ProfileSerializer: For serializing customer profile data.
ServiceSerializer: For serializing service details (you may re-use the one in the core app).
BookingSerializer: For serializing bookings.
ReviewSerializer: For serializing reviews.
URLs:

Define endpoints that the frontend can interact with, such as /api/v1/customer/bookings/, /api/v1/customer/reviews/, etc.
Permissions:

Use custom permissions to ensure only authenticated customers can access certain views.
You can define different permissions to restrict access to resources (like only allowing users to cancel their own bookings).
Example URLs for customer_portal:
/api/v1/customer/profile/ - View and update customer profile.
/api/v1/customer/bookings/ - Create, view, and manage bookings.
/api/v1/customer/notifications/ - View customer notifications.
/api/v1/customer/payment/ - Process payments and view transaction history.
/api/v1/customer/reviews/ - Submit and view reviews for services or partners.
Key Benefits of this Approach:
Centralized Customer Logic: All customer-facing functionality (profile, booking, payment, notifications) stays within the customer_portal, making the app more manageable.
Better User Experience: Customers interact with a dedicated part of the application tailored to their needs.
Scalability: You can scale the customer-facing features independently without interfering with the backend services or admin functionality.
Separation of Concerns: The customer_portal app focuses only on customer-specific logic, while other apps (like notifications, payments, etc.) handle their respective roles.
In summary, your customer_portal app should mainly handle customer-facing interactions like profile management, browsing services, making bookings, viewing notifications, handling payments, and reviewing services, while integrating with your existing specialized apps for notifications, payments, and bookings.
